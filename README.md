Learning to create and solve combinatorial games.

Since I have an interest in combinatorial game theory and chess, my end goal would be to create the strongest chess engine that I could possible make. Of course, this will take a while since I have only just begun my studies in mathematics and have a baby's worth of knowledge in Python and zero knowledge in machine learning. This is a first step in my learning process. 

The first program is a tic-tac-toe playing program where I can practice coding in Python and create a combinatorial game such as tic-tac-toe. At this present stage in the process, the game has no definitive GUI and lacks efficiency in the code. Eventually I will clean all of it up and perhaps create my own bot/algorithm or whatever you may call it using machine learning to solve tic-tac-toe myself.
